# How can we acknowledge open practices in hiring decisions?

* Felix Sch√∂nbrodt is collecting [**academic job offers that mentioned open science**](https://osf.io/7jbnt/). His department has instituted a hiring policy that [asks for plans and previous experience around transparent research](http://www.nicebread.de/open-science-hiring-policy-lmu/).
* There is an ongoing initiative to [**define and certify open research practices**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ty43Syw0Flkh8ncjW8MZArIkvYe8hLwwhLlIwbtSk_Y/edit) so that the individual or institutional level of experience with these practices can be assessed.
* Young academics of the [**Open Science Fellows Program**](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program) have drawn up the [**Berlin Call to Action for Open Science**](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program/Berlin_Call_to_Action), which are five recommendations to be implemented at scientific institutions, e.g. reward the additional effort related to Open Science.
